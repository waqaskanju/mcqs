option_two: 'Average cohesion goes up but coupling is reduced',
option_three: 'Average cohesion goes down and coupling also reduces',
option_four: 'Average cohesion and coupling increase',
answer: 'A',
explanation: 'Coupling exists in the form of two dependencies. Moving m from M1 to M2, decouples M2 from M1 but creates two for M1. So there is no change'
