  question: 'Which of the following is NOT a type of algorithm?',
  option_one: 'Program',
  option_two: 'Flowchart',
  option_three: 'Decision Table',
  option_four: 'Pseudocode',
  answer: 'A',
  explanation: 'A program is not a type of algorithm. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules for solving a problem, while a program is a set of instructions written in a specific programming language to be executed by a computer. Although a program may implement an algorithm, it is not considered a type of algorithm itself. Flowchart, decision table, and pseudocode, on the other hand, are different ways to represent algorithms'

  question: 'The symbol that represents comments in a flowchart is',
  option_one: 'A procedure symbol',
  option_two: 'An annotation symbol',
  option_three: 'A flow line',
  option_four: 'A subroutine',
  answer: 'B',
  explanation: 'Annotation symbol is used in flowcharts to provide additional information or explanations about the flowchart or specific parts of it. It is typically represented by a rectangle with a dashed or dotted line, and it contains text that describes the purpose or functionality of the associated flowchart element'

  question: 'The part of a decision table in which all the conditions, based on which a decision is made, is written is:',
  option_one: 'Condition Applied',
  option_two: 'Condition Stub',
  option_three: 'Action Taken',
  option_four: 'Action Stub',
  answer: 'B',
  explanation: 'The condition stub is the part of a decision table where all the conditions, based on which a decision is made, are written. It represents the set of conditions that need to be evaluated in order to determine the appropriate action to take. The condition stub acts as a placeholder for the conditions and helps organize the decision table by clearly defining the conditions that need to be considered'
